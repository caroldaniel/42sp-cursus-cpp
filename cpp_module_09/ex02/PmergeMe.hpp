/*
** PmergeMe
** --------
** This class is responsible for sorting a sequence of positive integers using
** the merge-insert algorithm, also known as the Fordâ€“Johnson algorithm.
** The Ford-Johnson algorithm is a sorting algorithm that combines the merge
** and insertion algorithms. It is a stable, in-place, comparison-based
** algorithm, that has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) and a best-case
** time complexity of O(n log n).
** In terms of overhead, the algorithm is not so efficient, since it uses
** computation comparisons to find the insertion point, and its a very well known
** algorithm to reduce the number of comparisons, keeping a good efficiency for 
** smaller sequences.
** -------------------------
** About the class structure
** -------------------------
** The class will be constructed with a string of positive integers, that will be
** validated and stored in a private string variable. The class will have
** a public member function called `sort`. Using function overload, the `sort`
** should be able to receive a vector or a list of integers, and sort them using
** the Ford-Johnson algorithm.
