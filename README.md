<p align=center>
CPP is the 12th project in the common core of the 42 ecole cursus. It introduces C++ and it's intended to be the student's first Object Oriented project.
Originally designed to be a mini piscine, CPP is composed of 9 modules that attempt to navigate through the most important concepts of Object Oriented programming while - hopefully - having some fun along the way.
