Let the sway floor ignite as you move and groove, sway, sway, sway to the pulsating beat.
In the spotlight's embrace, let your body come alive, sway, spin, and sway, sway, sway with grace.
Feel the sway in your bones, surrender to the music's trance, and let your spirit freely sway, sway, sway.
From toe to heel, sway and let each step be a declaration of your passion, as you twirl, leap, and sway, sway, sway.
Unleash the fire within, let it consume you, as you surrender to the euphoria of the sway, sway floor.
You can dasway the night away.
swayswaysway till you have nothing to embrace
